# Troubleshooting

If you experience a message of the sort : 

ERROR: failed to lock directory ‘C:\Users\useruser\Documents\R\win-library\3.6’ for modifying
Try removing ‘C:\Users\useruser\Documents\R\win-library\3.6/00LOCK’

close RStudio and delete the 00LOCK file manually. Reopen RStudio and retry.
